The mine you manually explode blows up at time 0.",

      "Implement an in-memory database that has the following functions. Weâ€™ll be looking for your code to meet our functionality & performance requirements, be clear & easy to understand and be resilient to edge cases. Use libraries at will (but not database-like ones or actual databases). Use Google/Stack Overflow/online references at will as well. The database should be a command line program that reads values from STDIN line by line and executes the functions as they happen. Please also include a README explaining how to run your program. The name and value will be strings with no spaces in them.",
    task: `SET [name] [value] - 

      Sets the name in the database to the given value - 
      
      GET [name] - 
      
      Prints the value for the given name. If the value is not in the database, prints NULL - 
      
      DELETE [name] - 
      
      Deletes the value from the database - 
      
      COUNT [value] - 
      
      Returns the number of names that have the given value assigned to them. If that value is not assigned anywhere, prints 0 - 
      
      END - 
      
      Exits the database - 
      
      The database must also support transactions: - 
      BEGIN - 
      
      Begins a new transaction - 
      
      ROLLBACK - 
      
      Rolls back the most recent transaction. If there is no transaction to rollback, prints TRANSACTION NOT FOUND - 
      
      COMMIT - 
      
      Commits all of the open transactions - 
      
      Performance Requirements: - 
      GET , SET , DELETE , and COUNT should all have a runtime of less than O(log n) , if not better (where n is the number of items in the database). The memory usage of the database shouldn't be doubled for every transaction.`
