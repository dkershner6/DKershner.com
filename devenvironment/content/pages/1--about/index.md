## Nearly all of the software I have developed is serverless

From the start of serverless technology's existence, I have whole heartedly embraced the cutting edge of the technology. In this effort, Azure Functions V2 (.Net Core 2.0) are the primary vehicle for our software. This, combined with static serverless websites primarily written in React provides the User Interface for all of the apps.
