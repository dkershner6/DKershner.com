This can take many forms:\n    -   Actual experience (time).\n    -   Certifications.\n    -   Interview-style question answering (including gotcha-style ones).\n    -   Portfolio / Testimonials.\n    -   Blog/Vlog/Demo - Something like LinkedIn ProFinder will not let you join without having several articles on their platform.\n-   The experience you do have will likely need to reflect well publicly. An example would be 5 years at Google will be seen as many multitudes more valuable than a smaller, no-name company.\n-   At least in my experience, contract jobs for Systems-side work (DevOps, IT) are more common than actual software development. It may also be possible that Software Development is more commonly a \"firm\" rather than a \"freelancer\".\n\n## Could be Either:\n\n-   You will need to appreciate and enjoy Business Development / Networking. I mean this, as it will be a significant and likely most important part of the job.\n-   You will need some familiarity with finance and tax law (not a lot but the more the better).\n\n# In-House\n\nThis one is more well-known, but I will list some items anyway.\n\n## Pros:\n\n-   You are likely to work less.\n-   Your payments will be more steady.\n\n## Cons:\n\n-   You are likely going to be following someone else's lead nearly 100% of the time, to a small or large extent.",
