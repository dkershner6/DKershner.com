                As a Bend resident and technology enthusiast for the past 13
                years, I have always been interested in G5's business, but no
                open position has truly been an exact fit for my skillset and

                        In my past, I have managed a large company's analytics
                        in a cross-department manner that involved coordination
                        and communication among disparate groups.

                    <li>
                        I have managed teams for the last 10 years, including
                        offshore members.

                    <li>
                        I have been developing software for the past 5 years,
                        including web applications, APIs, machine learning,
                        chatbots, and management & analytics portals. I have
                        been responsible for planning, design, development,
                        deployment, testing, and monitoring these applications.

                    <li>
                        I have very strong (10+ years) SQL experience, as well
                        as the less structured data formats. I have lots of
                        JavaScript experience, including TypeScript and React
                        (this cover letter and resume are written in it). On the
                        back-end, I do tend to prefer C# to Python for
                        performance reasons, but I have some experience with
                        Python as well.
