        Meg Chun, local CEO and interpersonal guru, has recommended your
        organization to me due to high regard for Preston Callicott. I place a
        lot of trust in her opinion of people and am excited to learn more about
        you guys throughout the process. The 1001 tech center is like a second
        home to me as I have worked remotely for the last 6 years.

            I have a proven track record by planning, architecting, developing,
            testing, deploying, running, monitoring, and optimizing many
            distributed, microservices based applications in the cloud for the
            past 6 years. This extends all the way from top to bottom, from the
            data stack to automated deployments using infrastructure as code. My{" "}

            I am a polyglot programmer able to be productive in several

            use TypeScript as I find it makes me more productive), and am also
            proficient in Python and Node, although I have less production
            experience there.

            I have experience in all the clouds, and while I have the most
            experience in Azure due to the way Amazon is viewed in the

            there to be much carryover to the others.{" "}

            I manage developers using Agile methodology (albeit scrum-less due
