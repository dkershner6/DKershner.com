      <h3>To CBT Nuggets Hiring Manager:</h3>
      <p className="mt-3">
        The more I look into your company, the more there is to like about it. I
        have a ton of experience as a user of online learning platforms and am a
        vehement supporter of the entire idea and industry. In my consulting
        experience, we actually were close to partnering with an Online
        University, and it has always been the idea I was most excited about. In
        addition, your stated values of honesty and integrity are critical to
        any business I would want to be involved in, and mirror my own
        requirements in co-workers.

        I think you will find my skillset and experience to be quite

          <li>
            I have a proven track record by planning, architecting, developing,
            testing, deploying, running, monitoring, and optimizing many
            distributed, microservices based applications in the cloud for the
            past 6 years. This extends all the way from top to bottom, from the
            data stack to automated deployments using infrastructure as code. My{" "}

            principles of how I design.

            I am a polyglot programmer able to be productive in several
            languages. You have specifically called out React, which is my
            strongest framework (
            <a href="https://dkershner.com/r/cbtNuggets">

            are written in React/TypeScript and use Babel/Webpack). I have lots
            of JS experience (I use TypeScript as I find it makes me more
            productive and the code more readable). I have learned Node, but
            will admit to having a lack of production experience due to
            primarily using C#. I am, however, happy to learn more, as I am
            finding JS more pleasurable to write with the modern ECMAScript
            releases. I have some Redux experience, but found it to be overkill
            for most of my project designs (likely not so for something as large
            as CBT Nuggets).
          </li>
          <li>
            I have experience in all the clouds, and while I have the most
            experience in Azure due to the way Amazon is viewed in the
            e-commerce world, I believe the providers are similar enough for
            there to be much carryover to the others.{" "}
            <strong>
              In addition, in preparation for this opportunity, I have taken AWS
              Certified Cloud Practitioner training.
            </strong>{" "}
            I have not yet taken the test, but am confident I could do so in a
            small amount of time. I have tons of experience with Azure Functions
            (Lambda), Azure Storage Blobs (S3), and event-driven architectures
            like message queues and service buses (SQS).
          </li>
          <li>
            I manage developers using Agile methodology (albeit scrum-less due
            to offshore time zone issues) and am familiar with organizing work
            into bite-size, time-sensitive sprints for myself and others.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have lots of experience in both relational (RDBMS / SQL) and
            non-relational (NoSQL) data structures. MSSQL and MySQL were the
            focus of the SQL side, and the NoSQL side is much broader, ranging
            from Key-Value stores like Redis or Table Storage, to Document
            stores like Mongo & Cosmos DB.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am both a heavy consumer and contributor to Open Source.
            ShopifySharp, the most popular .NET Shopify wrapper, is something I
            relied on heavily, and I am also one of top contributors as I
            required new features.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was also the DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer for all of our
            projects, and therefore have experience with Serverless, VMs,
            Proxies, and Containers. Throughout my experience, my favorite
            combination ended up being Kubernetes, Docker, and Nginx for larger
            projects, which appears to be a perfect match to what CBT uses.
