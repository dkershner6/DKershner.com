This book is broken down into 3 very, very distinct parts (not just my opinion, this is laid out in the foreword).  The first part is a detailed description of each of the concepts and the reasons why you should use them.  The second part is a very deep dive into actual code and how you get from point A to point Clean.  The third part is a wrap up tying the two other parts together (much shorter).

Of note, all code in the book is written in Java.  While this is obviously more helpful to developers with Java experience, I will be writing as a developer with NO Java experience.
